# Split flap board

Split flap display board for 28BYJ-48 motors
After seeing this design on thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2369832
I needed to have one so I designed a board to driver multiple of these units.
The board is based on I2C IO expanders and uln2803 since I had these in my drawer.
